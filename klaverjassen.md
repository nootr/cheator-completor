# Klaverjassen

My recipe to cheat at klaverjassen. This will make sure three chosen cards will
be dealt to your partner using nothing but what seems to be normal overhand
shuffles.

This is called a "blind" shuffle, which means that this routine should be
practised until it can be done blindfolded before using it in the wild.

## Techniques

The following techniques are used:
* Run X: pass X cards one by one
* In-jog: pass a single card, shifted towards you
* Out-jog: pass a single card, shifted away from you
* Throw: pass all cards until the break or end of deck
* Shuffle off: shuffle the rest of the cards normally

## The routine

The routine consists of six overhand shuffles and a cut. It is prepared by
determining the position of the target cards. This is quite easy to do during
the counting phase. Note that the number of every target card is relative to the
last card instead of absolute.

Cull three cards:

**TODO: determine if this is the best way to start (maybe a bit suspicious?)**

 1) Run one less than the first number
 2) In-jog running one more than the second number
 3) Out-jog running one less than the third number
 4) Throw

 5) Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog
 6) In-jog top card during downward motion of right hand
 7) Run one
 8) Throw
 9) Shuffle off

10) Under-cut to in-jog
11) Shuffle off

12) Under-cut about half the deck
13) Shuffle off, making sure the last three cards are kept together

The three desired cards should now be on top.

14) Under-cut about three quarters of the deck
15) In-jog running 6
16) Out-jog
17) Shuffle off

18) Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog
19) In-jog
20) Throw
21) Run 3
22) Shuffle off

23) Under-cut to in-jog
24) Shuffle off

Deal 3-2-3 and have fun.
