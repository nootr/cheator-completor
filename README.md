# Cheator completor

My recipe to cheat at my favorite game: *klaverjassen*, a game that uses 32
cards instead of all 52. This routine will make sure three of these cards will
be dealt to your partner using nothing but what seems to be normal overhand
shuffles, riffle shuffles and a cut. How awesome is that?

This is a so-called "blind" shuffle as it can be performed without looking at
the cards, so make sure you could do this smoothly while blindfolded before
using it in a real game.

## Techniques

The following techniques are used:

| Action      | Description                                      |
| ---------   | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Run X       | Pass X cards one by one                          |
| In-jog      | Pass a single card, shifted towards you          |
| Out-jog     | Pass a single cards, shifted away from you       |
| Throw       | Pass all cards up until the break or end of deck |
| Shuffle Off | Shuffle the rest of the cards normally           |

For example:

> In-jog running six

This means you pass a single card shifted a bit towards you and then pass the
other five cards loosely above it.

## Preparation

The routine consists of what looks like six overhand shuffles and a cut. It is
prepared by determining the position of the target cards which is quite easy to
do during the last counting phase. Note that the number of every target card is
relative to the last card instead of its absolute position in the deck.

## The routine

**First overhand shuffle - winning their trust**

*I showed this routine to a friend of mine. After explaining I was going to deal
my partner three aces, it was at this moment - during the first shuffle - he
said: "But now you cannot know where the aces are!" For me, this showed the
importance of this stage: it's the simplest of the six shuffles and looks the
most natural because no cards are being run one-by-one, which might be giving
the other person the feeling that you've lost control. So make it look like you
don't have control. Maybe even drop a card or two during shuffling off to give
the long runs in the next shuffle a bit more purpose.*
* Under-cut about half/third of the deck
* In-jog
* Shuffle off

**Second overhand shuffle - aiming for the aces**

*Now it's time to mark the targets. Two jogs are being made, creating three
packets of cards with all three aces placed on top or bottom of a packet. Place
all cards after the first jog randomly divided between the in-jog and the
out-jog to make it look like you're just sloppy and not creating jogs.*
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Run one less than the first number
* In-jog running one more than the second number
* Out-jog running one less than the third number
* Throw

**Third overhand shuffle - bringing them together**

*Now we know where the aces are, we will bring them together. This is the
hardest shuffle to do smoothly due to the in-jog that's being made by the left
hand which can easily disrupt the rhythm of the shuffles.*
* Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog
* In-jog top card with your left hand
* Run one
* Throw
* Shuffle off

**Fourth overhand shuffle - getting total control**

*The three cards are now packed together and marked by an in-jog. This shuffle
is meant to simply place these cards on the bottom of the stock.*
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Shuffle off

**Riffle shuffle - changing things up**

*The three aces are on the bottom of the stock, so this is the perfect moment
to do a couple of controlled riffle shuffles that keep the bottom cards.*
* Riffle at least three cards with the bottom packet
* Shuffle off

**Fifth overhand shuffle - lifting the aces**

*We want to give our partner the controlled cards, as this will look a lot less
suspicious. The easiest way to achieve this is to move six cards below our
controlled aces.*
* Under-cut about half
* In-jog running six
* Throw

**Sixth overhand shuffle - finishing off**

*Nothing special here. Just like in earlier stages, shuffle in a sloppy manner
to lower any suspicion about earlier in-jogs.*
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Shuffle off

**Cut the deck - following conventions**

*Any shuffle should end with a cut, so a quick and dirty false cut is made
here. A way to do this is to replace the sixth overhand shuffle with a cut to
the break made by the last in-jog, but I prefer a simple false cut which is
very deceiving, but requires no technical skills.*
* Kick-cut top half into left hand
* Tap side of right half on top of left half
* Throw right half on table
* Throw left half on top of right half

After seemingly harmless overhand shuffles, riffle shuffles and a cut you are
ready. Now deal 3-2-3 and have fun!

## Special cases

One important thing to note is what happens if one of the three numbers is 1. If
the first number equals one (the first card starts on top of the stock), nothing
special happens. Just follow the normal routine. However, things become
interesting when the second or third number equals one.

### Good news: the second number equals one

If the second number equals one, the first two cards are already together. This
means you can skip the 'Run one, then throw' steps in the third shuffle and
immediately run the packet of two cards and shuffle off. Also, because the
packet is always two cards, there's no need for the first in-jog of the second
shuffle! This means the second and third shuffles are as follows:

**Second shuffle; aiming for the aces**
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Run the first two numbers
* In-jog running one less than the third number
* Throw

**Third shuffle; bringing them together**
* Under-cut to in-jog
* In-jog top card with your left hand
* Run two
* Shuffle off

### Bad news: the third number equals one

This is a scenario you'd rather not be in. Notice the following steps during
the second shuffle:

* Out-jog running one less than the third number
* Throw

This means that - in this scenario - the out-jog step is skipped, so that the
throw that follows needs to be fully out-jogged. This seems unnatural and might
give away the under-cut that follows, so my advice is to avoid having a 1 as
third number and look for the next decent card you see during the preparation.
