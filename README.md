# Cheator completor

My recipe to cheat at my favorite game: *klaverjassen*. This routine will make
sure three chosen cards will be dealt to your partner using nothing but what
seems to be normal overhand shuffles. How awesome is that?

This is called a "blind" shuffle, as it can be performed without looking at the
cards. This is why I want to make sure I can do this smoothly while blindfolded
before I ever use it in a real game.

## Techniques

The following techniques are used:

| Action      | Description                                      |
| ---------   | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Run X       | Pass X cards one by one                          |
| In-jog      | Pass a single card, shifted towards you          |
| Out-jog     | Pass a single cards, shifted away from you       |
| Throw       | Pass all cards up until the break or end of deck |
| Shuffle Off | Shuffle the rest of the cards normally           |

For example:

> In-jog running six

This means you pass a single card shifted a bit towards you and then pass the
other five cards loosely above it.

## Preparation

The routine consists of what looks like six overhand shuffles and a cut. It is
prepared by determining the position of the target cards which is quite easy to
do during the last counting phase. Note that the number of every target card is
relative to the last card instead of its absolute position in the deck.

## The routine

*Optional: False riffle shuffle*

**First shuffle**
* Under-cut about half/third of the deck
* In-jog
* Shuffle off

**Second shuffle**
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Run one less than the first number
* In-jog running one more than the second number
* Out-jog running one less than the third number
* Throw

**Third shuffle**
* Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog
* In-jog top card during downward motion of right hand
* Run one
* Throw
* Shuffle off

**Fourth shuffle**
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Shuffle off

**Fifth shuffle**
* Under-cut about half
* In-jog running six
* Throw

**Sixth shuffle**
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Shuffle off

*Optional: False cut*

Deal 3-2-3 and have fun.
