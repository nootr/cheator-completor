# Klaverjassen

My recipe to cheat at klaverjassen. This will make sure three chosen cards will
be dealt to your partner using nothing but what seems to be normal overhand
shuffles.

This is called a "blind" shuffle, so please make sure you can do this routine
blindfolded before using it in the wild.

## Techniques

The following techniques are used:
* Run X: pass X cards one by one
* In-jog: pass a single card, shifted towards you
* Out-jog: pass a single card, shifted away from you
* Throw: pass all cards until the break or end of deck
* Shuffle off: shuffle the rest of the cards normally

## Preparation

The routine consists of six overhand shuffles and a cut. It is prepared by
determining the position of the target cards. This is quite easy to do during
the last counting phase. Note that the number of every target card is relative
to the last card instead of its absolute position in the deck.

## The routine

Cull three cards:

*First shuffle*
* Under-cut about half/third of the deck
* In-jog
* Shuffle off

*Second shuffle*
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Run one less than the first number
* In-jog running one more than the second number
* Out-jog running one less than the third number
* Throw

*Third shuffle*
* Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog
* In-jog top card during downward motion of right hand
* Run one
* Throw
* Shuffle off

*Fourth shuffle*
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Shuffle off

*Fifth shuffle*
* Under-cut about half
* In-jog running six
* Throw

*Sixth shuffle*
* Under-cut to in-jog
* Shuffle off

Deal 3-2-3 and have fun.
